# üë• Who We Are?
We are techi guys, frenchies :fr:, armed of rich experiences in the software industry.

Olivier is the first member of the CYBNITY team who initiated the adventure in 2022, inspired by the Dassault story which developed the Rafale fighter jet (flagship of french industry) as technology weapon optimized for the protection of our freedoms.

### We Have a Mission
We‚Äôre developing an open source technological platform that help the security teams to design and govern easily their company‚Äôs cybersecurity program, allowing them to create resilient digital systems against to cyber-threats.

We try to help the security experts to solve cybersecurity problems with complex areas to defend (e.g digital assets) and nwho eed efficiency to design and keep control of their Information Security Management System (ISMS).

### What We Build?
The CYBNITY platform makes it possible to design the strategic governance of the digital assets cybersecurity, and to pilot tactical operational protection systems guaranteeing the neutralization of security incidents. We develop a solution embedding the french excellence, in an interoperable and tactical software suite.

### What's Our Goal?
Our dream is to develop "__the Rafale of the cybersecurity__" with a approach privileging the quality, the mixing and merging of skills (e.g from police and military methods), and the rollouts of concret solutions integrated.
